  down instead. We need an array that compares all the numbers in it
  and erases all repeated numbers, so it's looking like a 
  for (){if ()} kind of scenario. Once the repeated values are erased
  they need to be sorted with a comparison algorithm, which is
  yet another for() if () condition where the numbers in the array are compared
  and re-arranged.
